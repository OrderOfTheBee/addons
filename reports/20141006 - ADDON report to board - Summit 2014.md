# Order of the Bee - Addons Committee Report - Summit 2014

Chair: Axel Faust (selection via https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/addons/issues/6)

Members: Angel Borroy, Ben Chevallereau, Charles Le Seac'h, Douglas C. R. Paes, Tahir Malik

## Activities and status

The following lists the main activities currently considered to be core to the addons committee and corresponding status.

### Definition of addon acceptance criteria

The committee needs to define both the non-technical and technical criteria for accepting addons to the listing maintained by the order. This also includes basic definition of a submission process once the listing has taken shape with the first committee-selected addons. All criteria are subject to regular review and if necessary updates.

Initial discussions have taken place about the scope of (mostly) technical criteria both via mailing list and GitHub issues. This has shown areas of potential conflict in terms of the added value we want to provide to the community by applying sensible / tough standards and the (limited) effort members may be able (or willing) to invest into the review process.
The chair is currently in the process of summarizing the points of view and preparing draft rule sets in the committee wiki. This should then be the basis for further discussion and - potentially - prototypical acceptance reviews of two or three addons chosen by the committee. After Summit has concluded, the chair expects the committee to aggree on first revision until start of November with first addon reviews being performed in November.

### Definition of addon listing structure

The committee needs to devise the primary pieces of content / information we want to include in the public listing (vs. interal data for organisation / collaboration on reviews). The committee needs to coordinate with web & marketing concerning additional contents and inclusion in the web page of the order once the raw structure has been agreed upon.

This activity is depdendant on acceptance criteria and has thus not yet been started.

### Acceptance review of addons

The committee will review addons to the core Alfresco project based on the currently valid acceptance criteria. This will initially focus on addons selected by members of the committee of having significance to the Alfresco Community or specific business cases, but 

This activity is depdendant on acceptance criteria and has thus not yet been started.

### Re-evaluation of listed addons

Any addons listed by the order are subject to re-evaluation by the committee when either Alfresco or Addon is available in a new version deemed stable enough.

This activity currently contains no actionable items.
